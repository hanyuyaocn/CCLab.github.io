                    This creature cannot reproduce on its own. It becomes alive after being left by human for many years.

                    The appearance of this clock is nothing special. However, since it has been abandoned in the water, its surface is severely rusted.

                    <li>The creature stays dormant until the environment is dry enough.</li>

                What do we know so far about the creature?
            </p>
            <p>
                The "timeways" come only from clocks discarded by human production and life. After a long period, 
                these clocks no longer draw energy from their own batteries but instead absorb energy from their surroundings. 
                However, the energy obtained from nature is not limitless. The more energy these creatures need, 
                the more time they consume, and as a result, the flow of time accelerates to meet their demand for time.
            </p>
            <p class="yellow">
                How do we interact with this creature?
            </p>
            <p>
                We can click on the creature to let it accelerate or decelerate the flow of time. You can also reverse the flow of time
                if you decelerate it for enough times!
