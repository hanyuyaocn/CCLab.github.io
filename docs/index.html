                <p>Timeway</p>

                <h3 class="yellow">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Hanyu Yao, Year 2048</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>This creature cannot reproduce on its own. It becomes alive after being left by human for many years.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Anywhere in the world because humans do not choose the place to leave what they do not want.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>The appearance of this clock is nothing special. However, since it has been abandoned in the water, its surface is severely rusted.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The creature stays dormant until the environment is dry enough.</li>
                    <li>The creature can control the flow of time.</li>
                </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="one-column">
            <p class="red">What do we know so far about the creature?</p>
            <p>The "timeways" come only from clocks discarded by human production and life. After a long period, these clocks no longer draw energy from their own batteries but instead absorb energy from their surroundings. However, the energy obtained from nature is not limitless. The more energy these creatures need, the more time they consume, and as a result, the flow of time accelerates to meet their demand for time.</p>
            <p class="yellow">How do we interact with this creature?</p>
            <p>We can click on the creature to let it accelerate or decelerate the flow of time. You can also reverse the flow of time if you decelerate it for enough times!</p>
